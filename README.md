### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron. A licensed and registered architect in the Philippines and an Assistant Professor at the College of Architecture, University of the Philippines, Diliman. I am currently a PhD Student at the University of Washington, Seattle under a Fulbright Scholarship studying Urban Design and Planning. My current research looks into scaling blue-green infrastructure in the built environment under a Wetland City framework. I'm currently learning about data science, urban informatics, and nature-based solutions. Visit my [github webpage](https://amlecciones.github.io) for more information.
